Voca is not ready for contribution. We actively work on: 

* How can we offer a good participation onboarding (code of conduct, welcome, agreements)
* How do we adapt our in-house dev. processes to the open-source community (product board, roadmap etc)
* How do we accept documentation contribution
* How can we have a transparent power agency (who decides on what)
